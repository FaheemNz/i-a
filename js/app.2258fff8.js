Unrestricted polygamy has been practiced in most human societies throughout the world in every age. Islam regulated polygamy by limiting the number of wives and establishing responsibility in its practice.",key2:"<blockquote>Marry those that please you of [other] women, two or three or four. But if you fear that you will not be just, then marry only one.<cite>- Quran 4:3</cite></blockquote>",subtitle1:"Who is objecting?",key3:"An <b>Atheist</b>, a <b>liberal</b>, a <b>Christian</b>? From an Atheistic paradigm, there is no way anyone could argue that polygamy is immoral, objectively speaking! Liberalism to the rescue but it is not Liberalism itself but the Liberal governments who have disallowed it. Similarly, in the Old & New Testament, almost every prophet practiced polygyny without any exceptions.",key4:"One might say, why can't a Women marry 4 Husbands? However, a woman marrying four husbands would only increase the problem of surplus women. Furthermore, no child would accept his or her mother identifying the father by the <strong>eeny meeny miney mo</strong> method.",key5:"Western anthropologists argue that polygamy is a genetic trait by which the strongest genes of the generation are passed on. Example, the lion king, the strongest of the pack, monopolizes the females thereby ensuring that the next generation of lion cubs will be his offspring.",key6:"Polygamy protects the interests of women and children in society. Men, in Western society, make the laws. They prefer to keep polygamy illegal because it absolves them of responsibility. Legalized polygamy would require them to spend on their additional wives and their offspring.",key7:"Monogamy allows them to enjoy extra-marital affairs without economic consequences. An average American male has at least seven extra premarital or extramarital affairs without any restrictions, according to a poll taken by Chicago Tribune. Also, you can literally see video-interviews of masses about their body-counts, the average number ranges somewhere between 12-20. If the woman becomes pregnant, the man can just move out and the woman has to take care of the child.",key8:"Men created polygamous because of a need in human society. There is normally a surplus of women in most human societies. The surplus is a result of men dying in wars, violent crimes, and women outliving men & the upsurge in homosexuality further increases the problem. If systems do not cater to the need of surplus women it will result in corruption in society.",key9:"An example: Germany after World War II, when suggestions to legalize polygamy were rejected by the Church. Resulting in the legalization of prostitution. German prostitutes are considered as workers like any other profession. They receive health benefits and pay taxes like any other citizen. Furthermore, the rate of marriage has been steadily declining as each succeeding generation finds the institution of marriage more and more irrelevant.",key10:"In the west, they do have polygamy: they just call them girlfriends, while Muslims do it in a legal way. Anyway - unrestricted number of extramarital affairs, unrestricted number of wives, no responsibility - compared to what Islam says i.e 100% responsibility! If you can't do that, marry only one.",subtitle2:"Conclusion",key11:"The question which remains is, “If God is good and wishes good for His creatures, why did he legislate something which would be harmful to most women?” Divine legislation looks at the society as a whole seeking to maximize benefit. If certain legislation benefits the majority of the society and causes some emotional harm to a minority, the general welfare of society is given precedence.",key12:"Plus, Polygamy is not a rule but an exception & it is crystal clear that if a man marries more than one wife (with the permission of his first wife), he has to give equal rights to all of them, if he fails to do so, there are consequences. And remember, this only applies under certain circumstances in some Islamic state - if someone is living in the West, he has to abide by the constitution."},Arranged:{title:"Arranged Marriages",key1:"Forced Marriage has got nothing to do with Islam - it is more of a cultural issue & what is cultural must be separated from what is essential! As a sidenote, in the Quran, there is just one marriage scenario mentioned where a women chooses her husband (Quran 28:23-28).",key2:"Islamic law requires that females must give their permission before they are married. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) said: <blockquote>A woman without a husband (or divorced or a widow) must not be married until she is consulted, and a virgin must not be married until her permission is sought. They asked the Prophet (PBUH): How her (virgin's) consent can be solicited? He (PBUH) said: That her silence is her consent. <cite> - Sahih Muslim, The Book of Marriage (Kitab Al-Nikah), Book 008, Number 3303 </blockquote>On one occasion a woman came to the Prophet (PBUH) and informed him that her father had married her off without her permission. He offered to annul her marriage, however, she did not accept his offer saying that she only wanted to confirm her right - A previously married woman has the right to choose for herself. The Quran says: <blockquote>O you who have believed, it is not lawful for you to inherit women by compulsion. And do not make difficulties for them in order to take [back] part of what you gave them unless they commit a clear immorality. And live with them in kindness. For if you dislike them - perhaps you dislike a thing and Allah makes therein much good. <cite> - Quran 4:19</cite></blockquote>",key3:"But wait a second, the Prophet (PBUH) also said: <blockquote>The marriage of any woman who marries herself without her guardian's consent is invalid. <cite>- Book 9, Hadith 1879 (Authentic)</cite></blockquote> This is why you just can't go to extremes on either side - Parents have their rights & children have their rights! The Hadith has to be juxtaposed with all the other Qur'anic ayahs and Hadiths & must not be taken out of context to fit one's narrative.",key4:"If the guardian refuses proposals for illegitimate reasons like the persons tribe, race, color, status, the young lady has the right to seek redress from the court. If the judge concludes that the father is wrongfully preventing his daughter from marriage, he may take the guardianship from the father and act as the girls guardian. ",key5:"Muslims are encouraged to help their children find suitable marital partners since males and females are raised separately in society. Women are spared having to look for their own mates. From a Western perspective, where teenagers are often required to leave home and go out to work and look after themselves, it would seem ludicrous for parents to, later on, suggest whom they should marry.",key6:"Similarly, It has become a practice among some Muslims to force their children to marry their cousins. For Muslims in the West, it becomes a means to help their family members also reach the West. Consequently, there have been a number of cases reported in the newspapers in England of the Home Office rescuing Muslim girls from forced marriages at the airport. There are also many Muslim girls who have run away from home rather than be forced to marry relatives in villages in Pakistan or India. Such girls are being given new identities by police authorities and will likely lose their Islaam in the process.",subtitle1:"Double standard in Marriage?",key7:"One might ask, why Muslim males are allowed to marry non-Muslim females but Muslim females are only allowed to marry Muslim males. This is often cited as discrimination and one of the symbols of oppression of Muslim females. The reply will be:",key8:"Muslim males are not allowed to marry any non-Muslim female. Only Christians and Jews (People of the Book) and not any other religion. This is due to the fact that the scriptures held sacred by Christians and Jews do contain large portions of revelation even though the texts have been distorted and changed. Consequently, in honor of the revelation still remaining in these texts, permission was granted to marry their women. However, the condition of chastity is added to the permission mentioned in the Qur'an.",key9:"Consequently, only a woman who is either a virgin, divorcee or widow can be married. This means that the common practice of Muslims from the East coming to Europe and America and finding blue-eyed blondes in discos for wives is quite illegitimate. Finding chaste females in the West is more difficult than finding the proverbial “needle in the haystack.” By mid-teens, virginity is looked at as a fault rather than a virtue.",key10:"The reason for allowing men and not women is in order to protect the woman’s religion. If a Muslim man requested his non-Muslim wife not to bring alcohol or pork in his house and that she not wear mini-skirts or kiss his friends, she could comply without affecting her religious teachings. However, If a non-Muslim husband requested his Muslim wife to purchase alcohol and serve him pork, to wear mini-skirts and kiss his friends since it is his custom to kiss the wives of his friends. It is natural for a wife to try to please her husband. In the case of the Muslim wife, that could lead to the destruction of her faith.",key11:"Marriage to non-Muslims is discouraged in situations where Muslims are weak or in the minority in order to safeguard the religion of the children. If a Muslim man marries a non-Muslim woman in the West and their marriage ends in divorce, or the man dies, the courts will award custody of the children to the wife who will likely raise them as non-Muslims. However, if they were married in a Muslim country, the Sharee'ah would not give the children to a non-Muslim mother. They would instead be given to either the husband or his relatives in order to ensure they receive a Muslim upbringing."},Aisha:{title:"Aisha (RA) Marriage to Prophet (PBUH)",key1:"The very first question that must be asked is, who is questioning? An Atheist is already out of the equation as there is no way he can say, anything is right or wrong, objectively. If there is no way of the Atheist ascertaining a full truth which is moral, then they have no business asking you any moral question because their premise is unsubstantiated.",key2:"Anyway, before 1900, a 10 years old bride was normal. Most of the people who use this as an argument are totally ignorant of Human history let alone the Islamic History as we will see:",subtitle1:"Did the Quresh object?",key3:"No! No accusations! No eyelids were batted. The Quresh called the Prophet (PBUH) a soothsayer, a fortune-teller, a madman - they used anything to tarnish his name by any means but never did anyone of them say 'why did you marry a 9 years old girl'? None of them said that to him, why, because it was normal it that time.",subtitle2:"Medieval Critics?",key4:"In the Medieval period, Prophet (PBUH) was criticized in Europe. Pope Urban II, in 1095, delivered a speech in a place called 'Claremont' where he encouraged the Christian Knights in Europe who were fighting with each other that why don't you unite and liberate the Holy Land from Infidels (Muslims according to him). The Prophet (PBUH) of Islam was painted as one of the worst people who ever lived in the history of humanity by the European clergy at that time.",key5:"The point is, the Medieval critics never used this against the Prophet (PBUH), why?, because it was totally normal even about their societies as well.",subtitle3:"Renaissance Authors?",key6:"During the renaissance and the 15th, 16th, and 17th centuries, did any of the Islam critics ever criticize the Prophet (PBUH) regarding this issue? The Ottoman Turks were a huge source of fear for the Europeans during the renaissance. Because of the Ottomans, Europeans wanted to paint the Turks in a bad light and how do you do so? by attacking their faith. But none of them criticized the Prophet (PBUH) for marrying Aisha(RA) at a young age.",key7:"Prideaux, in 1697, actually wrote a book specifically on the Prophet (PBUH) to attack him. But regarding this issue, he actually defended the Prophet (PBUH)! Please shot a glance at page 52 of his book <strong>The true nature of imposture fully displayed in the life of Muhammad</strong>.",key8:"Similarly, Ignaz Goldziher, a Hungarian Jew, and Theodore Noldeke who was German, both produced chunky volumes on Islam, no criticism on Aisha (RA). In fact, Thomas Caryly actually praised the Prophet (PBUH), he stated that Muhammad (PBUH) is one of the most maligned figures in Human history - people have unjustly, in particular European authors, throughout the Middle Ages and into the Renaissance period and into the Enlightenment period - they maligned him unjustly because of their religious or philosophical prejudice.",subtitle4:"Enlightenment  Thinkers?",key9:"Enlightenment Period is considered between 1700 to 1800, and who are the Enlightenment thinkers? Kant, David Hume, Isaac Newton, Jon Locke, Simon Oakley, Edward Gibbon, etc. Some of these people specifically wrote on the Prophet (PBUH), e.g Edward Gibbon wrote an entire chapter (No. 50) in his book 'The Decline & the fall of the Roman Empire' which was published between 1776 to 1783, where he specifically mentioned the marriage of Prophet (PBUH) but no criticism. Why? Because it was totally normal.",subtitle5:"Industrial Revolution & Victorian England?",key10:"During the 19th century, was there any criticism about this issue? No!

In order to ensure that the cause of the husband pronouncing divorce is not a product of behavioral changes brought on by PMS, divorce pronouncement during menses is prohibited. Secondly, the divorce cannot be pronounced during a period between menses in which the couple has had sexual relations. The rationale being that if the man cared enough about the woman to have sexual relations, he needs to reflect about his decision more before going ahead. He will have to wait until after the woman’s next menses ends, before he can pronounce the divorce.",key4:"The pronouncement is considered invalid if the man was in such a rage that he did not know what he was saying. This is based on the Prophet’s (PBUH) statement: <blockquote>The divorce pronouncement is not valid at the time of [mental] seizure. <cite>(Unconfirmed source)</cite></blockquote>",key5:"After the pronouncement, the divorce does not come into effect until the woman has had three subsequent menstrual cycles. The first cycle is to ensure that she is not pregnant and the second two are further opportunities for reconciliation. She is not supposed to leave her home as is common among Muslims today. The husband is required to continue to maintain her until the waiting period [iddah] ends.",key6:"If a woman is pregnant at the time of the pronouncement, her iddah is until she has delivered her child. This principle gives the maximum amount of time for reconciliation in order for the welfare of the child to be reflected upon.",key7:"In the final analysis, divorce proceedings are somewhat easier than in many Western countries [a notable exception being the well known “Mexican divorce” which can be concluded in a matter of minutes]. The theory being that marriage in Islaam is primarily a contract and not a sacrament as originally perceived in the West where it was considered unbreakable [and remains as such among Catholics]. Consequently, if the contract was entered into with a verbal statement of “I do,” and witnesses, it should be dissoluble with the statement “I don’t,” and witnesses.",subtitle1:"Saying Divorce 3 times",key8:"One thing that must be considered is, Divorce is strongly condemned in Islam! In case of difficulties within a marriage that the husband and wife cannot solve by themselves, each shall appoint an arbitrator or conciliator to resolve the matter. As the Quran says: <blockquote>And if you fear dissension between the two, send an arbitrator from his people and an arbitrator from her people. If they both desire reconciliation, Allah will cause it between them. Indeed, Allah is ever Knowing and Acquainted [with all things]. <cite> - Quran 4:35</cite></blockquote>",key9:"About saying the word <i>divorce</i> 3 times, the crux of this dispute can be found in the following authentic hadith: <blockquote>Abu al-Sahba' said to Ibn 'Abbas: Enlighten us with your information whether the three divorces were not treated as one during the lifetime of Allah's Messenger and Abu Bakr. He said: It was in fact so, but when during the caliphate of 'Umar (RA) people began to pronounce divorce frequently, he allowed them to do so.<cite>- Sahih Muslim, 9:3493)</cite></blockquote>",subtitle2:"Divorce is only man's right",key10:"Muslim women are often portrayed as being oppressed due to their being denied the right to divorce.",key11:"The pronouncement of divorce (talaaq) is primarily the right of the husband as he is in the position of authority in the family. Also, PMS considerations and the emotional nature of women could cause a greater incidence of divorce if it were put the hands of the wives as an automatic right.",key12:"The wife may institute divorce proceedings by making her request through the court. If the judge (Qaadee) sees just cause or a real need on her part, he can act on her behalf and institute the khula' divorce which has a waiting period of only one menstrual cycle.",key13:"A woman can obtain the right to pronounce divorce if it is made a condition in her marriage contract which her husband agrees to. She may also gain the right by requesting her husband’s permission at any point during the marriage. If permission is given she may pronounce divorce according to the previously mentioned conditions.",subtitle3:"Are Men more important than women?",key14:"(*)The base of feminism is, men and women, both are socially, politically, and economically equal.",key15:"Islam regards mothers as more important than fathers. <blockquote>A man came to Prophet (PBUH) and said, O Allah's Messenger (PBUH)! Who is more entitled to be treated with the best companionship by me? The Prophet (PBUH) said, Your mother. The man said. Who is next? The Prophet(PBUH) said, Your mother. The man further said, Who is next? The Prophet (PBUH) said, Your mother. The man asked for the fourth time, Who is next? The Prophet PBUH) said, Your father. <cite>- Sahih Bukhari 5970</cite></blockquote> Based on the aforementioned Hadith, a Mother is 3 times more important than the Father. So in the context of parental responsibility, the woman is more important than the man.",key16:"If the mother is more important than the man, in the context of the familial relationship and we have equal rights than that would mean mothers are generally more important than men. If the husband and wife are 50/50 and the mother and father are 75/25, if you add up the aggregate, you would have more for the women than the man - there won't be equality! In order for there to be equality, Allah has allowed for certain rules to be given to man and not to the woman, in the context of the husband-wife relationship.",subtitle4:"Need for a Decision Maker",key17:"If there is gridlock between the husband and the wife and there is no way of finding a resolution - the husband doesn't transgress the woman's fundamental rights and tell her to do something which is anti-Islamic - then it is the man's opinion which goes!",key18:"Generally, it is more like a Venn-diagram, it is not black and white and there are lots of overlaps between. Law is the same for man and woman, spiritually both are equal - so how come Islam allows the man to be more superior as a husband in e.g divorce. Man can easily divorce while it is slightly difficult for the woman.",key19:"Someone might say, it must also be equal here to which the reply would be: why don't you apply the same criteria in your parliaments? You have the first-past-the-post system in parliaments, why, because you need a decision-maker there. If there is a gridlock situation and you don't have any decision being made - that creates confusion, that creates no-movement-forward. If it is allowed in the parliaments, at macro-levels, why not in the micro-levels?",subtitle5:"Who should break the gridlock?",key20:"So the question arises, who should be the one to break the gridlock, we say, the man because the woman already has a higher influential power with the kids. How could we counter-act that power, we have to counter-act it by putting something in the law because if you don't then you will have transgressions of power, a woman can easily turn the kids against their father and the father can't do anything to counter-act that.",key21:"If we use the American constitution as an example, you have checks & balances such that the executive branch checks the executive branch checks the legislature and they all check each other. If you eradicate that, you are eradicating the checks & balances that should exist, in order for a functional system to take place.",key22:"If you see the divorce rates, from 1960 to 2020, you would notice they are going up & up, why? Because the disagreements happen in the marriages and there is no solution, it is a total gridlock situation. So the Islam says let the man finish it off, just like the kids - they have a decision to make, who should they be better to, the mother or the father - let them have an affinity to the mother, that way there is a pure equality which manifests itself in a different way."},Inheritence:{title:"Inheritence Objections",key1:"The unequal division of inheritance between men and woman is sometimes cited as an example of Islam's oppression of women.",key2:"Before looking at the division of inheritance in Islam with regard to women, one needs to look at Western inheritance laws. The right for women to inherit and own property was only given to women in the West at the turn of the century, whereas that right was given to women in Islaam 1,400 years ago.",key3:"Furthermore, in the West, a person may legally write a will giving all of their wealth to their dog or cat and exclude their wife, children, and other relatives. In the Islamic system, the rights of wives, children and relatives to inherit are protected. Set portions of the inheritance to be given to them are identified in the Quran.",key4:"No one can write a will and cancel or modify what is due to them. A will can be written to give up to a maximum of one third to those who would not inherit by law. As to leaving even the third of one’s wealth to animals, the Muslim State could step in on behalf of the inheritors and cancel such a will as it obviously indicates some form of mental disorder. The third would then be divided up among the natural inheritors.",key5:"In an Islaamic society men are responsible for the maintenance of women. For example, if a son, a daughter and a mother inherit, the son also has the additional responsibility of looking after his sister and his mother. Consequently, based on the male role, Islamic Law awards the son twice the portion of the daughter.",key6:"However, the two to one division is not applied in all cases. For example, the Quran states (4: 11): “If a man or woman [died and] left neither descendants for ascendants, but left behind a brother or a sister, each gets 1/6th; and if they are more than two, they equally share 1/3rd.",key7:"So it is not black and white & different things should be treated differently on account of their difference."},WomenWitness:{title:"Two women equal to one Man",key1:"The finger is also pointed at Islaam as considering women inferior since the witness of one man is equal to that of two women.",key2:"The Quran does state in Al-Baqarah (2: 282): Get two of your men as witnesses. But if two men are not available, then get a man and two women agreeable to you as witnesses, so that if one of them makes a mistake, the other can remind her... However, this principle is not applied in all cases. This is specific to business contracts as the beginning of the verse indicates.",key3:"This consideration may seem quaint in the West where women have been a part of the workforce for much of the 20th century. Women entered the workforce as a product of the need for them in the society and the munitions factories during the two World Wars. Millions of men in their prime were sent overseas to fight and their jobs had to be filled by women. Once the wars ended, many refused to return to their homes, and the feminist movement was born.",key4:"Eventually, many women came to look at fulfillment in the workplace and not at home. Even if her job was only that of a secretary, harassed by her boss, smiling sheepishly to keep her job, she felt it was better than being stuck at home cooking, washing dishes, changing diapers and preparing bottles of milk. Many Western women became familiar with business dealings, so the previously mentioned considerations would seem to them irrelevant. However, even in America, the vast majority of women are housewives, spending most of their lives in their homes, while their husbands work and bring home the bread.",key5:"Nonetheless, In areas of female expertise, the witness of a single woman is sufficient. The witness in Islam is different than the narrator. The narrator narrates the Hadith, they are basically narrating all the way back to Prophet (PBUH) and as we know some of the greatest Narrator in Hadith are women e.g <strong>Aisha (RA)</strong>, and one woman equal one man in this context, as a narrator of the Hadith. <strong>This is more important than anything else because you are transmitting the deen itself, so as a narrator there is no suspect or indifferent treatment between man and woman.</strong>",key6:"So it is a witness we need to talk about. Why it is always said that women have fewer rights as witnesses, <strong>why not fewer responsibilities</strong>? Punitively and classically, what happens to the witnesses if they are seen to speak falsehood? They get lashed - even if one of four witnesses is caught lying, all of the 4 are lashed. If this was the case, and a woman was being lashed and she didn't do anything wrong, the objection would have been: how can you punish the woman when she did nothing wrong? If we did have the same responsibilities for man and woman in this context, then there would be complaints as described before.",key7:"Considering the punitive repercussions of false testimony, this is preferential treatment for women. It is a mercy from Allah that he doesn't put a woman in that position because why would they be put in a position where they are susceptible to more physical pain, in an <strong>Islamic state</strong>."}},Violence:{Jihad:{title:"Jihad",key1:"Usually translated by the Western media as “holy war” is a greatly misunderstood principle in Islaam. There is no term in Arabic which means “holy war”.

Murrah Federal Building, in Oklahoma City on April 19, 1995 killing 168 people, he was not labeled as a 'Christian terrorist', though he was Christian and a terrorist. In fact the “Muslim terrorist” label was attached to the activities of the PLO who were a mixture of Muslims, Christians and communists. The PLO is not, nor was it ever, a Muslim organization. It is a nationalist organization working for the establishment of a secular Palestinian state.",key11:"The face of terrorism can be seen in the extremist movements of Egypt. Al-Gama’a Al-Islamiya (Islamic Group) and Jihaad Movements provided shock troops for a bitter struggle with Egypt’s security forces that caused about 1,200 deaths from 1992 to 1997 but failed to topple Hosni Mubarak’s secular rule. The Gama’a claimed responsibility for the Luxor massacre of tourists in November 1997. However, in March 1997 its exiled leaders declared a unilateral truce and renounced violence. The philosophy of these movements and their program of action have been loudly condemned by leading Muslim scholars internationally as well as local Egyptian scholars.",key12:"Islaam opposes any form of indiscriminate violence. The Qur’aan states:<blockquote>Anyone who has killed another except in retaliation, it is as if he has killed the whole of humankind.<cite>- Quran 32:5</cite></blockquote> There are strict rules regulating how war may be conducted.

Combining that with equality, some people would ask why women have to wear headscarves or certain clothing?\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      One of the undercurrents or assumptions of feminism is that women are being oppressed, there is a patriarchal society. If you look at the sociological statistics on the kinds of oppression that are going on - from male to female or how the patriarchy is being exacerbated - you can divide into the different kinds of strands.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      You can say there is an economic layer, a political layer, a domestic layer, or a social layer. One thing that is often overlooked is sexual objectification and commodification. Really and truly, if you look at the contents of most male magazines, you will find that the majority of the information that is presented in those magazines are the pictures of women. Women are being used, commodified, objectified to promote products but if you think about it, this does nothing but strengthen the patriarchy, patriarchy which feminists want to dispel.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Women are literally used as objects in Movies, Sports, UFC & WWE, Night Clubs, Porn, Commercials, and what would remedy this situation?

A woman who is covered, she is oppressed - a woman who is naked, she is independent.

As God transcends space, we naturally would not associate with Him spatial limitations. For instance, we would not say that God literally descends to earth or walks in the garden. Equally, we would not insist that God is a three-dimensional being or that He travels from one point in space to another.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      In the same way, we should not demand that God have a past, present, and future, for this assumes that His existence is as ours, in time, and again this conflicts with His transcendence. Even the most rabid atheist, in an effort to prove the illogic of the concept of God,\n      would not suppose that God might be on a bus from Chicago on His way to New Orleans because he knows that such a hypothesis is unacceptable to a believer. It is equally erroneous to assume God\'s being was confined to a particular point or interval of time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      We have little difficulty accepting the idea that God\'s knowledge can encompass two different points in space simultaneously. This is perhaps because we assume that the attribute of transcending space implies a unique vantage point. We could compare it, however imperfectly, to the experience of being high above the ground and having simultaneous knowledge of very distant events. With respect to time, unlike space, we are immobile.\n      We can not travel forward or backward in time. \n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      An hour from now, we will\n      be at an hour from now. That can not be changed. Therefore, it is more difficult to comprehend that God\'s existence is independent of or beyond time, as indeed it must be, for it is impossible to conceive that His being is contained within or constrained by any of the dimensions of the very spacetime environment that He created for us to live and grow in. Once again, because of His unique vantage, point, His knowledge encompasses all events, regardless of their distance in space or time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Another key point, well established in the Qur\'an, is that our perception of time is not objectively real. As noted earlier, the Day of Judgment is portrayed as a different order of creation, one in which we suddenly comprehend that our former perceptions of time are no longer valid.\n      </p>\n\n      <blockquote>It will be, on the Day they see it, as though they had not remained [in the world] except for an afternoon or a morning thereof. <cite>- Quran 79:46</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>And on the Day when He will gather them, [it will be] as if they had not remained [in the world] but an hour of the day, [and] they will know each other.<cite>- Quran 10:45</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>They will murmur among themselves, You remained not but ten [days in the world]. We are most knowing of what they say when the best of them in a manner will say, "You remained not but one day."\n      <cite>- Quran 20:103-104</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <blockquote>He will say, How long did you remain on earth in a number of years? They will say, We remained a day or part of a day; ask those who enumerate. He will say, You stayed not but a little - if only you had known.\n      <cite>- Quran 23:112-114</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>\n      Interpreters will always render all references to the Day of Judgment in\n      the future tense, because from our perspective that is when it will take place. Several of the passages, however, actually employ the present and past tenses. Commentators assert that this is a literary device that stresses the inevitability of these happenings, but it seems that the use of the present and past tenses in referring to the Day of Judgment also reinforces the notion that it will take place in a very different environment, one in which our current conceptions of time and space no longer apply.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The question "What is the value of prayer if God has already predestined the future?" assumes that in some way God has a future. That is, it assumes that God is situated in time, as we are, and that as we pray,\n      He is peering into a preordained future. But in order to have a future, one\'s existence must be contained within-and hence finite-in time. The reason this question leads to contradictions is that it assumes a contradiction in the first place: that God both transcends and is finite in time.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      Any question that assumes two mutually incompatible premises will always result in conflicting conclusions. Assume, for example, that a circle is a square. We may ask if a circle has corners. If we emphasize the circle\'s roundness, the answer is no. If we concentrate on the properties of a square, the answer is yes. When two assumptions lead to a contradiction, at least one of them must be false. Thus, in such a situation, it should be asked if the question itself makes sense, and if all premises are necessarily true.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The word "predestination" is itself problematic. If we mean by it that\n      God in the past had programmed the events of the future, the assumption is that God exists in time. If instead, we mean that God\'s wisdom, knowledge,\n      and power encompass all and nothing in creation can conflict with that,\n      then that has to be admitted. However, this is not the primary sense of "predestine," which means "determine in advance," and it does not conflict with the notion that God responds to our prayers.\n      </p>\n      ',subtitle1:"If Allah knows everything then where is the test?",key2:"\n      <p>\n        The very first question that must be asked is, what are the things Allah won't do - the things that would stop him from being Allah?

So the question is, can Allah create a scenario whereby we are doing our own things by our free-will & Allah is doing it at the same time?\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      The only reason one might say, no, this is not possible is that it would stop Allah being Allah. But as Allah is competent over all things, he can create such a situation - no matter how overwhelming it is for us to fathom, the hows of it, the metaphysics of it, the strings of it - we are not gonna get this. There are 2 tests basically, one which Allah has filled out for us, and the second which we have to write ourselves - and both of them are corresponding! How? Allah knows best! \n      </p>\n\n      <p>Nowadays, People talk about meta-physics as if they have understood everything else.

It is not the eyes, or nose, or legs, or arms, or hairs, or face, or feet! It is not the heart or brain as they keep working for some time even one is dead!

As mentioned before, the real question is, can Allah create a scenario where this doesn\'t happen?</p>\n\n      <p>\n      The objection is, why Allah is creating a Human which he knows will end up in hell? Why doesn\'t he create other people, give them free-will, and judge? To which the response is: if he should not create a Human which he knows will end up in hell, why on earth should he create a Human which he knows will end up in Paradise? Why not directly put him in Paradise because he knows, even after giving him free-will, the person will go to Paradise so why not directly put him in Paradise? And the loop hole continues...\n      </p>\n\n      <p>\n      And once again, this goes back to, why create Humans in the first place? And once again, the answer Allah gives is <blockquote>And mention, when your Lord said to the angels, Indeed, I will make upon the earth a successive authority. They said, Will You place upon it one who causes corruption therein and sheds blood, while we declare Your praise and sanctify You? Allah said, Indeed, I know that which you do not know.<cite>- Quran</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p><strong>I know what you don\'t know</strong> & yet there is dispute. Look at what the Quran is saying about all these silly riddles and assumptions:</p>\n\n      <blockquote>Those who associated with Allah will say, "If Allah had willed, we would not have associated [anything] and neither would our fathers nor would we have prohibited anything." Likewise, did those before deny until they tasted Our punishment. Say, "Do you have any knowledge that you can produce for us? You follow not except assumption, and you are not but falsifying." <br /> <strong>Say, "With Allah is the biggest argument. Had he willed, He would have guided you all."</strong><cite>- Quran 16:148-149</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>We just can\'t fathom how all of this works, we will never get it but for Allah, it is very easy. For example, Take a robot, no matter how hard it tries it will never know the <strong>whats & whys</strong> beyond the limit which is set by the one who has developed it - but for the one who has developed it, it is dead simple. Isn\'t the same case with Humans?</p>\n      ',subtitle3:"Eternal Hellfire",key4:"\n      <p>This question is linked with the previous ones & the answer is very simple - we are not given license to judge salvation! In the Quran, Allah is speaking, and he can speak however he likes! We can't speak on his behalf. For example, just like a king is speaking and there are hundreds of servants in his court - the king becomes angry at 'servant x' and says something loudly and the 'servant y' repeats the same sentence, who do you think is in trouble? To put things in perspective, the Quran says to the Prophet (PBUH):</p>\n      \n      <blockquote>Indeed, [O Muhammad], you do not guide whom you like...<cite>- Quran 28:56</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>Similarly, Prophet (PBUH) once said to her daughter Fatima (RA): \n      <blockquote>O Fatimah, rescue thyself from the Fire, for I have no power (to protect you) from Allah in anything except this that I would sustain a relationship with you.<cite>- Sahih Muslim (Book 1, Number 0399)</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Remember, don't take Hadiths out of context. The above Hadith have a context, Prophet (PBUH) said this when the following verse was revealed: <blockquote>And warn your nearest kindred...<cite>- Quran 26:214</cite></blockquote></p>\n\n      <p>Similarly, the Quran says everyone will come individually on the day of Judgement and who are the people who are safe? The ones who have a sound heart as the Quran says: <blockquote>\"The Day whereon neither wealth nor sons will avail. But only he (will prosper) that brings to Allah a sound heart<cite>- Quran 26:88-89</cite></blockquote>\n      Now how do we know someone has a sound heart? We don't!\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Something that is worth considering is: Allah wants to guide us, he doesn't want to punish us. </p>\n\n      <blockquote>What would Allah do with your punishment if you are grateful and believe?<cite>- Quran 4:147</cite></blockquote>\n      <blockquote>And We did not wrong them, but they wronged themselves.<cite>- Quran 11:101</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>There are some people who are worried about hellfire being <strong>eternal</strong> but again, they are just following assumptions. It is up to Allah to do whatever he likes with whoever he likes! The one who is using Eternal hellfire as an argument, one might ask where did you get this, he will say, from the Quran. But the same book, the same source is also saying Allah is just & loving. If he is saying he is just then you have to be rest assured, no injustice will happen to a Muslim or a non-Muslim!</p>\n\n      <p>If someone deserves the hellfire, he will confess it himself! If he himself doesn't have a problem then there is no room for dispute! As the Quran says: \n      <blockquote>They will say, “Our Lord, You gave us death twice and You gave us life twice. Now we confess our sins. So, is there any way to come out of here?” <cite>- Quran 40:11</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      <blockquote>Thus they will confess their sin. So, away with the people of Hell!\n      <cite>- Quran 67:11</cite></blockquote>\n      </p>\n\n      <p>If people were directly put in Hell, they would soon argue that Allah did not test them or give them the opportunity to strive. They'll have no such argument on the Day of Resurrection. They were given reason, messengers and books were sent as the Quran says: </p>\n\n      <blockquote>And if We had destroyed them with a punishment before him, they would have said, \"Our Lord, why did You not send to us a messenger so we could have followed Your verses before we were humiliated and disgraced?\"\n      <cite>- Quran 20:136</cite></blockquote>\n\n      <p>Now the question remains about the eternal hellfire. One thing that must be considered here is, the punishment depends on the severity of the crime. If a 20 years old kills someone & he is sentenced to a lifetime jail, is it just? It took 1 second to pull the trigger so the punishment must be 1 second? We can increase it, 2 seconds? 3 seconds? 1 minute? 1 hour? 1 day? 1 month? 2 months? 1 year? 2 years? Forever??? See, this fallacious analogy doesn't even work in this life.</p>\n\n      <p>About the hellfire being eternal: what do you mean by the word \"eternal\"? Again going back to what is being alluded to, we don't know! We don't know what eternity means in the next life! To put things in perspective, whenever the Quran talks about hellfire being eternal, it uses the word <strong>خالدون</strong> which is translated as <strong>eternal</strong>. However, in 3 places (regarding hell), the word <strong>الأبد</strong> is explicitly added to the word <strong>خالدون</strong> albeit they both have the same meaning!</p>\n\n      <p>\n      But whenever the heaven and hell are mentioned together, Allah uses the word <strong>الأبد</strong> with heaven but not with hell. See Chapter 98-6,98-8 & 64:9, 64:10. There are some scholars like Ibn Taymiyyah & Ibn Arabi according to whom hellfire will come to an end - others say something different! Similarly, in the following verse, different wording is used:\n      <blockquote>\n      In which they will remain for ages [unending].\n      <cite>- Quran 78:23</cite>\n      </blockquote>\n      Notice the word that is used is <strong>اَحۡقَابًا</strong> which means successive periods. According to most scholars from early generations, Huqq'b is 80 years.\n      </p>\n\n      <p>Maybe, Allah has literally given us a hint by adding the word <strong>الأبد</strong> to not indulge into the knowledge of the unseen. It is up to him to do whatever he likes, what if the disbelievers (not non-Muslims) get punished for, say, 100 years and then Allah totally ends there existence [soul]?
